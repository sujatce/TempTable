Is the field CAMPAIGN_MONTH coming from Optum in that format? "SEP-2025" That will make it very hard to query.  This field is very similar to REPORT_MONTH or SURVEY_MONTH which we store in the format "2025-09-01".  If it is possible to convert to that format before loading it would be preferable.
 
Please be sure to store all dates as YYYY-MM-DD followed by the timestamp, if required.  It could be just Excel is showing me the example this way but I want to be certain we don't store it that way in Snowflake.
 
 
For the descriptions, I think we can align on a standard for these few (there will soon be cards to add these across the whole server):
 
Column Name	Description
GMPI_ID	WellMed unique member identifier
MBI	Member Beneficiary Identifier issued by CMS to identify Medicare beneficiaries
MEMBER_LAST_NAME	Last name of the member enrolled in the health plan
MEMBER_FIRST_NAME	First name of the member enrolled in the health plan
MEMBER_BIRTH_DATE	Date of birth of the member enrolled in the health plan
FILE_NAME	Name of the file tied to the record
FILE_CREATION_DATE	Date the file was created
USER_STORY	User Story ID associated with data ingestion or update
INSERT_DATE	Timestamp recording when the row was first inserted into the table
INSERT_USER	User or system that inserted the row
UPDATE_DATE	Timestamp recording when the row was last updated
UPDATE_USER	User or system that last updated the row
