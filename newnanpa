Here’s a clear, enterprise-ready table description for SMS_DELIVERED that fits well alongside your SMS_OPT_OUT description and will read cleanly in documentation and audits:

SMS_DELIVERED – Table Description

The SMS_DELIVERED table stores delivery and processing information for outbound SMS messages sent as part of UHC membership campaign outreach. It captures message-level details including campaign context, scheduling and lifecycle timestamps, platform processing status, and carrier-reported delivery outcomes.

This table is populated from SMS delivery reports generated by the SMS Manager system (including post-campaign delivery status updates). It is used to support campaign performance reporting, delivery rate analysis, operational monitoring, and compliance validation in conjunction with member consent and opt-out data stored in the SMS_OPT_OUT table.

If you want a slightly more concise version (for schema headers or data dictionaries), here’s a shorter alternative:

SMS_DELIVERED contains message-level delivery and status details for outbound SMS communications sent as part of UHC membership campaigns. The table tracks scheduling, platform processing, carrier delivery outcomes, and campaign attributes to support reporting, auditing, and compliance analysis alongside SMS opt-out data.

If you’d like, I can also align this wording exactly to your organization’s standard data-dictionary format (e.g., “Source,” “Grain,” “Refresh Frequency,” etc.).
