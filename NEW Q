While deploying the code, I had a merge conflict with Robert's commit on the same file. The prior file which robert created is not visible in my latest pull  as I found later that since he has some issue in the code the change was not visible in my latest pull.  I sent a message to him on my Friday afternoon  and I didnot hear back and so I was trying to resolve the conflict by keeping his change and trying to move my changes to a new file. So I deleted my branch and was trying to create a new branch and new file and few minutes later I found that my table is created. I am confirming with Robert that his changes are still there in the file.
