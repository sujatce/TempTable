I’m seeing an issue when loading data from an Alteryx workflow into Snowflake.

When I manually run the Alteryx workflow and load datetime columns into a Snowflake table (stored as TIMESTAMP_NTZ), the values end up +2 hours ahead of what I see in Alteryx.

My understanding is that this is likely due to the Alteryx Snowflake connector performing an implicit timezone conversion during insert. It seems to assume the incoming datetime is in a local/session timezone and converts it before writing to Snowflake — possibly treating the value as Pacific time and converting it to Central time.

I’ve already verified that my Snowflake user timezone is set to America/Chicago, but the shift still occurs at load time.

Has anyone else encountered this behavior with the Alteryx Snowflake connector?
If so, what is the recommended approach to prevent this implicit timezone conversion (without hard-coding offsets)?
