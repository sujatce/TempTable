--While deploying the code, I had a merge conflict with Robert's commit on the same file. I did saw that the prior file which was created is not visible in my latest pull.  I sent a message to him on Friday and I was trying to resolve the conflict by keeping his change and trying to move my changes to a new file. But before I wanted to do that I saw my table is created. I am confirming with Robert that his changes are still there in the file.
