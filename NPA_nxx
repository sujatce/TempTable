COMMENT = 'The WellMed Central Quality Reporting team produces member campaign data for internal and external stakeholders. To prevent members from being contacted using invalid or inappropriate phone numbers, reference data is required to validate telephone number prefixes.

The NANPA NPA-NXX (Central Office Code Assignment) dataset is sourced from the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), the regulatory authority that manages telephone numbering resources across North America. It provides the authoritative mapping of area code and prefix combinations (NPA-NXX) to service providers, geographic rate centers, and usage classifications.

This data enables identification of prefixes that are assigned, pooled, reserved, vacant, or otherwise unavailable, including those designated for business, government, toll-free, or non-service use. Downstream processes use this reference to filter out invalid or non-consumer phone number ranges and ensure outreach is limited to appropriate member numbers. This dataset is stored in the NANPA_NPA_NXX table.';
