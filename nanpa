Make sure control table has only 1 active row
SELECT VIEW_NAME, COUNT(*) cnt
FROM ASQN_DEV_CFG_DB.DBO.CFG_VW_CONTROL
WHERE VIEW_NAME = 'VW_WM_ONE_TEAM_CORE'
GROUP BY VIEW_NAME;
B) Compare row counts (view should be <= table)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS table_cnt
FROM ASQN_DEV_ORCHESTRATION_DB.DBO.ONE_TEAM_CORE;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS view_cnt
FROM ASQN_DEV_ORCHESTRATION_DB.ACCESS.VW_WM_ONE_TEAM_CORE;
C) Confirm min/max UPDATE_DATE in view is within control window
SELECT
  MIN(UPDATE_DATE) AS min_update_date,
  MAX(UPDATE_DATE) AS max_update_date
FROM ASQN_DEV_ORCHESTRATION_DB.ACCESS.VW_WM_ONE_TEAM_CORE;
